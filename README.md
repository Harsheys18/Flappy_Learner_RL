# Flappy Learner 🐤

Reinforcement Learning agent for mastering the Flappy Bird game.

This project serves as a **mentorship guide** for my mentees participating in **Summer of Code 2025**. It also acted as my personal practice project to explore game-based RL environments and prepare to support others effectively.

## 🎮 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build and train a reinforcement learning (RL) agent that can learn to play the Flappy Bird game autonomously.  
The game environment is adapted from a classic Pygame implementation of Flappy Bird.
